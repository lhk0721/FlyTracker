# 7 조준기를 위치가 고정된 포대로 바꾸기

## Document Relations
- Issue: #7
- Branch: `7-feature-fixed-turret`
- Umbrella: (none) — no umbrella issue exists yet
- Related: #1 (built the flying aimer), #3 (projectile note), #4 (fly threat rule)
- Status: done

## Summary
Turns the aimer into what the user meant from the start: a turret at a user-set position that only turns its aim, like an anti-aircraft gun. Issue #1 had built a camera that flies around the room; the move axes, the moving-aimer option, the position and velocity observations, and the distance and collision rewards are removed.

## Goal
- The aimer never changes position; the agent controls yaw and pitch rates only.
- The position is one configured value (`EnvConfig.turret_pos`, `--turret-pos`), default `(0, 1.2, 1.4)`: centred in front of the +z wall at 1.2 m, facing into the room.
- Capture has no distance condition by default (a turret cannot close the distance); `--capture-range` can add one.

## Scope
- `flytracker/aimer.py`: 2-D action (`yaw_rate`, `pitch_rate`); `AimerLimits` keeps the angular limits only; `Aimer.step(action, dt)`; no velocity, no wall clamp.
- `flytracker/env.py`: `turret_pos` (checked to be inside the room, list → tuple in `from_dict`); `capture_range: float | None = None`; the fly is placed at least 1.5 m from the turret; the start aim faces the room centre horizontally unless `start_facing_fly`; observation 19-D → 13-D (`closeness` → `distance` / room diagonal; `position`, `velocity` removed); reward drops the distance and collision terms; `collided` removed from info and snapshot.
- `flytracker/wrappers.py`: 5 discrete actions (idle, yaw left/right, pitch up/down).
- `flytracker/baseline.py`: rotate-only rule aimer.
- `flytracker/record.py`: `collided` frame key removed.
- `flytracker/fly.py`: docstring only (with a turret, the distance shrinks only when the fly flies toward it).
- `scripts/`: `--fixed-aimer` removed, `--turret-pos X Y Z` added, `--capture-range` defaults to none; stale "파리 모드" help text in `train.py` fixed.
- `tests/`: `test_aimer.py` rewritten; `test_env.py` updated plus turret-position, out-of-room and no-distance-capture tests.
- `viewer/src/scene/ThirdPersonView.jsx`: frustum depth falls back to 0.8 m when `captureRange` is null.
- `README.md`.

## Out Of Scope
- The fly's threat rule for a turret (the user deferred it until after this change).
- Difficulty: the rule baseline now captures every episode (see Current State).
- Projectile capture (#3).

## Done Criteria
- [x] `uv run pytest` passes, including tests that the turret never moves and stays at the configured position. (2026-11-09)
- [x] Baseline capture rate measured on seeds 0-39 at the default turret position. (2026-11-09)
- [x] `scripts/train.py` finishes short SAC and DQN runs with the new action and observation spaces. (2026-11-09)
- [x] `npm run build --prefix viewer` builds; UI evidence shows the turret at its position without overflow. (2026-11-09)

## Current State
- Change committed and PR opened; the `AGENTS.md` pointer was removed in the branch's last commit.
- The task became easy for the rule baseline: 40/40 captures, mean 1.92 s to capture, capture distance 0.71-2.62 m, no alarm onsets. A fixed turret with no distance condition only needs to keep a 0.5 m/s fly inside 3 deg for 0.2 s. How to make it harder (capture by projectile per #3, longer hold, narrower FOV, faster or evasive fly, a turret-appropriate threat rule) is the user's next decision.

### chore: 조준기를 위치가 고정된 포대로 바꾸기 (#7)
> why: issue registered, branch and worktree created, this document seeded
#### Scope
- Management doc, Master Registry row, `AGENTS.md` pointer.
#### Changes
- `docs/issues/feature/7-feature-fixed-turret.md` filled from the user's correction (aimer = fixed turret like an AA gun; flying code removed; position as one configured value).
- `docs/issues/README.md` +1 row; `AGENTS.md` Recent Active Context pointer.
#### Verification
- `issue-start`: issue #7, branch from `origin/main` @ ce79745.
#### Notes
- No umbrella issue yet, so `--parent` was not passed.

### feat: 조준기를 고정 포대로 바꾸기 (#7)
> why: the user's aimer is a turret at a fixed position that only turns; the flying aimer from #1 was a misunderstanding
#### Scope
- `flytracker/` (aimer, env, wrappers, baseline, record, fly docstring), `scripts/`, `tests/test_aimer.py`, `tests/test_env.py`, `viewer/src/scene/ThirdPersonView.jsx`, `README.md`, this doc.
#### Changes
- As listed under Scope above: 2-D action, fixed `turret_pos` (default `(0, 1.2, 1.4)`), no distance condition by default, 13-D observation, reward without distance and collision terms, 5 discrete actions, rotate-only baseline, `--turret-pos` replaces `--fixed-aimer`.
#### Verification
- `uv run pytest`: 26 passed (24 before; the 5 movement tests in `test_aimer.py` replaced by 4, plus 3 new env tests).
- Baseline, `RuleAimer`, seeds 0-39, default turret: 40/40 captured, mean 1.92 s, capture distance 0.71-2.62 m, 0 alarm onsets. For comparison, the old fixed-aimer option (random position per episode) captured 32/40.
- `scripts/record_baseline.py --episodes 5`: 5/5; `--turret-pos 1.5 0.5 -1.2 --capture-range 0.8 --episodes 3 --no-save`: 0/3 (the fly rarely comes within 0.8 m), both run.
- `scripts/train.py --algo sac --steps 2000 --eval-every 1000 --eval-episodes 2` and the same with `--algo dqn`: both finish and save 3 evaluation sets (runs written to the scratchpad).
- `npm run build --prefix viewer`: builds (chunk-size warning only).
- ko-writing `check.py README.md`: sections 1-8 clean.
- UI evidence: `node .claude/skills/ui-evidence/scripts/shot.mjs --name after` with the repo overlay (`http://localhost:5180`, served from this worktree).
  - Commit: ce79745 (dirty, this change) · Chrome: 156.0.8078.74
  - Serve check: `document.title === 'FlyTracker' && document.body.innerText.includes('10:19')` (the only run in this worktree's `runs/` was recorded at 10:19)

| page | viewport | file | overflow | probes | console |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| / | 1600x900 | `after-1600x900.png` (scratchpad) | none | readouts: 상태 포획 중, 조준 오차 0.6°, 거리 2.59m, 포획 진행 100%, 초파리 평시, 프레임 46 / 46 | favicon 404, THREE.Clock deprecation, GL ReadPixels perf warnings |

  - Desktop: the turret body sits in front of the +z wall and its frustum (0.8 m deep) points into the room at the fly 2.59 m away.
#### Notes
- The `captureRange` meta is now `null` by default; the viewer falls back to a 0.8 m frustum.

### chore: 작업 마무리와 AGENTS.md 포인터 제거 (#7)
> why: the branch's last commit before the PR; `main` takes PRs only, so the pointer must go now
#### Scope
- `AGENTS.md`, this doc's Status and Current State, the registry row.
#### Changes
- `AGENTS.md` Recent Active Context: pointer line removed, `- (none)` placeholder restored.
- Status: in progress → done, here and in `docs/issues/README.md`.
#### Verification
- `grep -c 7-feature-fixed-turret AGENTS.md` prints 0.
#### Notes
- The user asked to merge when done and to show a local preview afterwards.

## Management Notes
### Follow-up Candidates
- Difficulty for the turret task (see Current State).
- Fly threat rule for a turret: what a fly can sense from a fixed turret (its turning motion, a shot's sound or air flow).
- #3's 1 m range assumption against the default turret position (the farthest corner is about 3.7 m away).

- User correction, 2026-11-09: "방공포는 고정된 위치에서 조준을 움직일 뿐이지 날아다니지 않아."
